Personal Project of Pushing the limits of turning GameMaker Studio 2 into a 3D voxel engine. 
Currently it has the foundations, but it needs some debugging and cleaning.

Features:
- Perlin Noise to make the surface look natural
- Hidden Surface Removal / Culling
- 3D block with varying types and customizable graphical surfaces
- Chunk generation with depth and height
